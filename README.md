Trailer Relocation Optimization Project
An analytical project that used demand forecasting, location data, and telematics to improve trailer placement across cities. Focused on cutting repositioning costs, reducing idle equipment, and making sure trailers were always available where demand was highest. Combined data analysis, geospatial mapping, and cost optimization to support smarter, more efficient trailer moves.
